PIE -> Planetary Image Editor

This server was created to simplify the figure making process for planetary researchers in the USGS but could be used by anyone with an email. It was first thought up by Laszlo Kestay and with the help from the POW development team at the USGS it became the last connection in a web-based processing pipline that connects PILOT, POW, and PIE in a smooth workfow that removes the need for researchers to learn ISIS3 command line interface programs. With PIE we are also connecting an image editor to the pipline to create publication ready images with less effort.
